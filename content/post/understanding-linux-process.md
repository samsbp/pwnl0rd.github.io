We will have an hands-on with linux process and how it works. Ofcourse, we may have studied Operating System but we didn't have interest because of enough practical knowledge. Understanding the concepts of  Operating System will help in developing robust & perfomance-oriented applications. It also helps in penetesting (cybersecurity).

## What is a process?
  I hate definition but no other go buddy :) . Process is a program in execution. Then you may have a question, what is a program?. In this context, a program is an executable file. In every operating system, there is a format for file to be  executable.
  Windows - [PE format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable)
  Linux - [ELF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)
  Mac - [MACH-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O)

The executable files should be in one of the format, respective to the operating system.

## /proc/self
